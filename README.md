I used a React.js front-end and a Node.js/Express backend to create my Science News app.  Recent science articles are fetched by React from the backend server using Axios and React Hooks. Node/Express fetches the data from gnews.io

React Router handles routing between the Home and About pages. 

You may view the deployed app on Heroku: https://my-science-news.onrender.com/
